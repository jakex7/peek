# Peek

Peek supplies the Glance pieces AndroidX does not yet provide: notification composition and
extensible custom components translated to RemoteViews.

## Modules

- `peek-glance` provides custom Glance components.
- `peek-notification` composes Glance content into `NotificationCompat` custom views.
- `peek-emittables` inserts prebuilt Glance emittable trees, provides a multiprocess AppWidget
  adapter for low-level tree producers, and composes such trees into notification views.

## Glance fork resolver

Peek `0.3.1` is pinned to Glance `1.2.0`. Apply the resolver plugin once in the consuming
Android project:

```kotlin
plugins {
  id("io.github.jakex7.peek.glance-fork") version "0.3.1"
}
```

Then add Peek dependency:

```kotlin
dependencies {
  implementation("io.github.jakex7.peek:peek-notification:0.3.1")
}
```

Continue declaring normal `androidx.glance` dependencies. The plugin substitutes only
`glance-appwidget` with
`io.github.jakex7.peek.forks:glance-appwidget:1.2.0-peek-0.3.1`, including transitive requests
from multiprocess and testing artifacts, and fails the build if another Glance version is present.

## Notifications from emittable trees

Tree producers that already hold Glance `Emittable` trees can skip composable content:

```kotlin
val views = peekEmittableNotificationViews(
  context = context,
  collapsed = collapsedRoot,
  expanded = expandedRoot,
)
NotificationCompat.Builder(context, channelId)
  .setSmallIcon(R.drawable.ic_notification)
  .setPeekContent(views)
```

`setPeekEmittableContent` composes and attaches in one call. Both live in `peek-emittables`, which
depends on `peek-notification`.
